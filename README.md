# UbuntuSetup

This repository contains a script that I hacked together to ease the PITA that was the installation of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I've suffered enough, let the others suffer less.

If someone wants to add more to this script or change something, do let me know! Feature requests are welcome (because I'm running out of ideas on what to implement). Or you can contribute by forking the repository and adding your code.

### Usage

Clone or download the repository, then run these commands to use the script.
The script's got a menu, so using it shouldn't be too hard.

```
cd UbuntuSetup
chmod +x UbuntuSetup.sh
./UbuntuSetup.sh
```

Seriously? You need a license for a meagre script?
